Part 1: Bar or Line Graph (Myeongnin)

Using csv data file of Eye and Hair color, created bar and line graph.
It initailly creates bar graph and by clicking a box "switch to line graph", it changes to line graph.

Part 2: Unique Visualization (Dylan Kile) 

There are six classes: Planet, Planets, GUI, Button, Timer and main
Planet is an object that has a mass, eccentricity and period. The class allows for the display and change in a planet's orbit. 
Planets is a class that maintains all the planets, allowing for simultaneous display and movement of all the planets. 
Timer is used to delay the speed at which a time step occurs (currently set at 100 milliseconds). 
Button is used to create interactivity allowing the user to select which planet is displayed, as well as change the page of planets the user is looking at. 
GUI shows all the necessary buttons and allows the user to interact with the buttons. 
A complication is that sometimes it requires multiple clicks to actually activate the button.

Part 3: RSS Reader (Karl Solomon)

There are six classes: Article, ArticleLegend, Button, Feed, RadioButton, Main.
Article - Has a button that when clicked will open article url in web browser. Hovering will show the article's source/timestamp.
ArticleLegend - The "web pages" where articles are derived from. Shows the color-scheme of articles.
Button - Handles simple mouse hovering, clicking, color, and text
Feed - A unique RSS feed that the user can select to view. ****I elected to use a scroll view for previous/next functionality since I find this more user-friendly and cleaner.
RadioButton - Button that only allows selection of one feed at a time
Main - Sets up GUI container for the feed, article legend, and feed description at the top of the file
