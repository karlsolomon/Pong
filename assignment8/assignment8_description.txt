Part 2: Unique Visualization (Dylan Kile) 

There are six classes: Planet, Planets, GUI, Button, Timer and main
Planet is an object that has a mass, eccentricity and period. The class allows for the display and change in a planet's orbit. 
Planets is a class that maintains all the planets, allowing for simultaneous display and movement of all the planets. 
Timer is used to delay the speed at which a time step occurs (currently set at 100 milliseconds). 
Button is used to create interactivity allowing the user to select which planet is displayed, as well as change the page of planets the user is looking at. 
GUI shows all the necessary buttons and allows the user to interact with the buttons.
