Part 2: Unique Visualization: 
Click Run 
To have a planet show up, click the button corresponding to a planet. 
To have multiple planets selected, just click another button. 
To deselect a planet, just click the button again. 
Clicking the ">>" and "<<" buttons allow you to cycle through the pages of planets to select or deselect as necessary. 
If you hover over one of the planet's buttons, it will display the mass, eccentricity and period (the three dimensions) of that planet.

Part 3: RSS
Click Run
To switch between Feeds click the radio buttons in the bottom right.
To view more articles on the feed than what are currently visible scroll up/down (this is in lieu of previous/next button function since this is more user-friendly).
