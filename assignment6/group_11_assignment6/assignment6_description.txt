Project's Intended Simulation: 
Two mice (one always goes left; the other always goes right) compete to complete a randomly generated maze.

Classes: 
	Maze: Maze creates the maze and generates the single path to the exit. Uses points and lines to make the maze. 
	      It functions on two rules: An end point cannot coincide with another point, and every point within the maze must belong to a line.
		
	Mouse: The Mice function on three rules.
		Both: Cannot cross over lines in the maze, and must always find a solution to the maze.
		LeftMouse: Must go left if able.
		RightMouse: Must go right if able.

	Point: Used in constructing the maze and tracking mice movement. 
	Line: Is composed of two points for the maze and also converts mazeCoords to mouseCoords.

Unexpected Challenges: 
	Debugging (all good now tho).
