Animation Description
    This animation is a simple bowling throw.
    The thrower throws a strike every time because they're pretty good at bowling.
    This is a personal bowling alley so it only contains one lane. Good bowlers have these.

Classes:
    Ball - 
    Lane - 
    Pins - Pins outer class w/ inner Pin class. This creates the pins, drops the pins with a metal bar in front, and organizes the pins in an equilateral triangle. It also scatters the 10 pins when hit by the bowling ball. 
    SoundEffects - 
    Wall - 

Unexpected Challenges:
    Getting objects in Maya to load color into processing was difficult.
    Getting a realistic ball and pin collision was difficult since we didn't exactly know how to model that.
